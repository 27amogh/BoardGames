# C++ Board Games
This repository is a container of two players board games with AI engine. The engines are not supposed to be state of 
the art, but they should work reasonably well. In fact the goal of this project is two-folds:  
- Learn software development in C++ 
- Learn AI for games

The first game to be implemented will be TicTacToe, which is the easiest game around, especially to build an AI. 
While gaining more experience with this project, new games will be added to explore more features of C++ for engineering 
and new game algorithms. 
At the moment, the most complex game to add is chess. We are not interested in games that can be solved only through 
a massive use of resources with deep learning.  

This code is meant for educational purpose, and thus anybody that shares the same goals should 
feel free to contribute or to use it under the license agreements.

## Provisional list of games to support

- Backgammon
- Reversi (multiple sizes)
